PNDbotics is committed to building an efficient, end-to-end  humanoid robot platform that streamlines the development, simulation, and deployment processes of AI robots, and further drives breakthroughs in robotics and embodied AI.
As a full-stack developer and manufacturer of humanoid robots, We possess well-developed robotic technologies fused with artificial intelligence technology. The technologies we adopt are shown below:

- Model-Based Robot Gait Planning
- Whole-Body Motion Control Technology
- Embodied Intelligence Algorithms
- Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based motion control technology
